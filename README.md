# Airline-PowerBi-Analysis
Welcome to the Airline Analysis Power BI Project repository! This project focuses on empowering airline companies with actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business growth. Using Power BI, we transform raw airline data into a visually compelling and interactive dashboard that supports strategic decision-making.

Project Overview
The project is divided into six key tasks that form a structured approach to data analysis and visualization:

1. Data Preparation and Cleaning
The first step involves importing and transforming raw datasets to ensure clean, usable data. We addressed issues such as:
--Removing duplicate entries
--Resolving null values
--Ensuring consistent column formats
--This process guarantees that the foundation of our analysis is robust and meaningful.

2. Data Modeling
--We established relationships between datasets, such as linking FlightID across tables, and set cardinality to accurately represent the data. This step ensures seamless integration of multiple datasets, allowing for smooth navigation and analysis.

3. Enhanced Data Insights
We created conditional columns to categorize flights into actionable statuses like:
--"Best" – indicating high performance
--"To Be Improved" – highlighting areas for growth
--This categorization simplifies complex data, making it easier to pinpoint underperforming routes and prioritize improvements.

4. Calculations Using DAX
With Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), we computed critical metrics, such as:
--Total passengers per flight
--Total tickets booked
--Filtered tables for “Best” flights
--These calculations provided the numerical backbone for our insights and visualizations.

5. Visualizations and Interactive Features
We created dynamic visualizations that display trends such as:
--Passenger count by airline
--Booking statuses
--Popular destinations
--Interactive features allow stakeholders to drill down into data by airline, destination, or ticket status, fostering a deeper understanding of business performance.

6. Dashboard Creation
--The final dashboard consolidates all key visuals for an at-a-glance view of performance. Row-Level Security (RLS) was implemented to ensure data confidentiality, restricting access based on user roles.

#Key Insights for Growth
This analysis provides actionable insights to support the airline’s growth strategy:

---Identify "Best" flights and replicate their operational models across the network.
---Pinpoint routes needing improvement and implement changes like better scheduling or enhanced customer experience.
---Analyze passenger counts to optimize seat allocation and catering services.
---Evaluate booking statuses to refine ticketing processes and promotional strategies.
---Visualize high-demand routes and plan for new destinations or increased flight frequency.
---Leverage trends in ticket booking for dynamic pricing and targeted promotions.
---Dashboards with real-time data provide decision-makers with actionable insights for continuous improvement.
